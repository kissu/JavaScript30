# Challenge 6, JSON fetch cities
The goal here was to get fetch some data from an external API, and to filter the results based on some user's input.

### What I learned
`fetch` method is pretty like the old one `XMLHttpRequest`, it's sends us a
  promise. It can be used with the keyword [`then`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) to use the success return.
