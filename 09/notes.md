# Challenge 9, some console log tips
Not really a challenge, just some cool stuff to know.

### What I learned
Here is a list of the possible `console.*` that people can do in their
  terminal:
- log
- warn
- error
- info
- assert
- group (/groupCollapsed & groupEnd)
- count
- time
- table
- clear

All of those can also be found using `console.log(console)`.
